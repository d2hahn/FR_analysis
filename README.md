# FR_analysis
## Summary
Code for obtaining magnitude and phase frequency response from measured voltage data, in TDMS file fomrat, from two sensors using a NI DAQ/LabVIEW experimental setup utilizes both Python and MATLAB. Allows user to select portion of time-domain data they want to use for frequency response analysis, and determines magnitude and phase FR at a 95% confidence level in the uncertainty in the calculated values. User can then estimate a TF fit to the data and obtain uncertainty in estimated parameters. Original use of code was for master's thesis work obtaining presure transient transfer function across tubing in a microfluidic system. As such, current code setup converts voltages to pressures, only considers a freqeuncy range from 0.01 to 0.4 Hz, and considers fitting a first-order function, but these can be easily changed to morph the code for general applications. Each code file has its own in depth commenting/description outlining functions of the specific file, and lines that could/need to be changed to enhance/change the output. More work has to be done to make code more general.
